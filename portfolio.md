## Profile
Mechanical engineer and consultant delivering digital tools for the built environment, underpinned by industrial engineering experience and applied research in materials and machine learning. I connect mechanical domain knowledge with software engineering to automate workflows, surface insight faster, and keep multidisciplinary teams aligned.

## Core Skills
- Programming & DevOps: JavaScript, Python, Go, C# (.NET & Unity 3D), REST APIs, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Git.
- Engineering & Analysis: CAD (Solidworks, Creo), digital twins, VR, finite element studies, machine learning, lifecycle simulation.
- Delivery & Collaboration: Agile/SCRUM, failure investigation, risk management, cross-functional leadership, client advisory.

## Professional Experience
### Ramboll | Graduate Consultant - London, UK (Sep 2024 - Present)
- Produced a VR-ready full-stack web and desktop application that binds CAD models to interactive documentation, including automated CAD-to-OBJ/GLB conversion, metadata extraction, and Word-to-HTML/CSS pipelines to remove manual processing.
- Enhanced a production wind asset management platform with Azure SSO and SMTP services, managing Dockerised deployments, CI/CD, and Google Cloud Kubernetes infrastructure to improve uptime and security.
- Extended a Python-based lifecycle simulation tool with new analysis features, a REST API, and a web interface so non-technical colleagues can interrogate project scenarios, contributing within Agile SCRUM sprints.
- Deliver interdisciplinary advisory scopes for offshore wind projects with global Ramboll teams.

### Cummins | Design Engineering Placement - Darlington, UK (Jun 2022 - Jun 2024)
- Developed engine components from concept through production while aligning designs with emerging EU and US regulations.
- Applied generative Creo workflows in partnership with CFD and FEA specialists to tune complex geometries for performance and manufacturability.
- Led feasibility studies for new European-market technology, building concepts, cost models, and presenting recommendations to stakeholders.
- Chaired a global cross-functional team applying the 7-Step process to resolve a live product issue, coordinating risk mitigation through implementation.

## Selected Projects
### Digital Engineering Tools
- [NextCMMS](https://next-cmms.vercel.app/): Go, PostgreSQL, and Next.js maintenance management system with a flexible physical/EAV schema, role-based authentication, and planned 3D model ingest plus IoT telemetry.
- [Digital_Design_Manager](https://ddm-iota.vercel.app/): Automation workflow that transforms legacy CAD data into interactive VR documentation sets, aligning CAD, metadata, and technical copy for project delivery teams.
- [Search Map](https://searchmap.web.app/): Web tool using Google Maps APIs, Firebase, and cloud services to locate prospects by name, type, and geography; filters, stores, and exports data, cutting more than 100 hours of manual research for a wholesale client during COVID lockdowns.
- [FEA Sandbox](https://rpatton.vercel.app/fea/index.html): Browser-based teaching tool that builds 2D finite-element models, applies loads and boundary conditions, and exposes intermediate matrices to help students grasp the method.
- [Operational Analysis Platform](https://rpattn.github.io/WOMBAT_ext/): Full-stack Python/TypeScript/Docker application that wraps National Wind Technology Center simulations for non-technical users, automates post-processing and Gantt outputs, and deploys static assets via CI/CD.

### University & Research
- Masters Dissertation â€“ Eventum Orthopaedics: Validation programme for novel medical hardware covering standards review, experimental design, and verification testing.
- [Hydro Turbine Optimisation](https://rpatton.vercel.app/projects#turbine): First-principles modelling of a Pelton turbine, solving nozzle geometry and gearbox ratios in MATLAB and simulating transients in Simulink to maximise efficiency.
- [Erosion-Corrosion](link coming soon): Extended group research by training predictive models to forecast material degradation, combining experimental data with ML pipelines.

### Earlier Engineering Initiatives
- [Daring Dash](https://rpatton.vercel.app/projects#daringdash): Led design and manufacture of an autonomous buggy, using MATLAB kinematic models to optimise suspension behaviour and coordinating team delivery.
- [Truss Bridge Analyzer](https://rpatton.vercel.app/projects#trussbridge): MATLAB GUI that evaluates member stresses against tension/compression limits and visualises results to support structural design exercises.
- [McLaren F1 Study](https://rpatton.vercel.app/projects#mcf1): Independent vehicle dynamics study estimating performance metrics; integrated a custom gear-change model in Simulink to improve transient accuracy and earned extra credit.
- [Stabiliser Analysis](https://rpatton.vercel.app/projects#wing): Finite element assessment of a Robinson R22 horizontal stabiliser; automated composite ply optimisation through Python scripting.
- [Raspberry Pi Projects](https://rpatton.vercel.app/projects#pi): Early hardware and robotics experiments around a Raspberry Pi that sparked a long-term interest in software-hardware integration.
- [Unity Games](https://rpatton.vercel.app/projects#games): Self-initiated Unity projects that matured gameplay scripting and systems design skills.
- [Android Apps](https://rpatton.vercel.app/projects#apps): Small applications built in Java and C#, reinforcing mobile UI patterns and deployment workflows.
